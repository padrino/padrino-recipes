## Preface

Padrino is a Ruby framework built upon the excellent [Sinatra Microframework](http://www.sinatrarb.com). Sinatra is a
DSL for creating simple web applications in Ruby with speed and minimal effort. This framework tries hard to make it as
fun and easy as possible to code much more advanced web applications by building upon the Sinatra philosophies and
foundation.


The recipes consists of two types: *plugins* and *templates*. A plugin adds additional functionality to an existing
Padrino project. A template can be used as a template for a completely new Padrino application.
